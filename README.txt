Demo app that was originally created as part of the interview process at FreeWheel.

This project is updated to demostrate use of common techniques used in API development. Covers Mediatr, AutoMapper, Unit Testing, In  Memory database, controllers, services, entity framework, data seeding from files, fluent validation, fluent assertions, "rich" domain models, DTO's, Ardalis enums, swagger, postman, swashbuckler, etc

Arguably the project is completely "over engineered" for such a trivial app. I concurr. However the purpose of this repository is as a demo of concepts used in larger systems and also as an "aide memoire" for my own record.
